Readme

I use C++ to write the program.


So just open it with xcode(if use Mac) and run the program
Or open the executable file in terminal 


After the program started, input the start point and goal point(range 0-17), If the points hit the block point(or out of range), you will be asked to re-enter the points again.

Be careful, the input should be, for example, 0 0, use whitespace between the x and y coordinate. not(0,0) 

Then you will get the output.
